        <p>ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30,
            2022. It uses large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o along with other multimodal models to generate
            human-like responses in text, speech, and images.[3][4] It has access to features such as searching the web,
            using apps, and running programs.[5][6] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of
            rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[7] Some observers
            enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.[8][9]

            ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is
            fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement
            learning from human feedback.[8] Successive user prompts and replies are considered as context at each stage
            of the conversation.[10] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its
            popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o
            but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased
            usage limits and access to additional features or models.[11] Users on the Pro plan have unlimited usage,
            except for abuse guardrails.</p>

        <h2>Deep seek</h2>
        <p>Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd.,[3][4][5][a] doing business as
            DeepSeek,[b] is a Chinese artificial intelligence company that develops large language models (LLMs). Based
            in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Deepseek is owned and funded by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer. DeepSeek was
            founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the co-founder of High-Flyer, who also serves as the CEO for both
            companies.[7][8][9] The company launched an eponymous chatbot alongside its DeepSeek-R1 model in January
            2025.

            Released under the MIT License, DeepSeek-R1 provides responses comparable to other contemporary large
            language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and o1.[10] Its training cost was reported to be significantly lower
            than other LLMs. The company claims that it trained its V3 model for US$6 million—far less than the US$100
            million cost for OpenAI's GPT-4 in 2023[11]—and using approximately one-tenth the computing power consumed
            by Meta's comparable model, Llama 3.1.[11][12][13][14] DeepSeek's success against larger and more
            established rivals has been described as "upending AI".[15][16]

            DeepSeek's models are described as "open weight," meaning the exact parameters are openly shared, although
            certain usage conditions differ from typical open-source software.[17][18] The company reportedly recruits
            AI researchers from top Chinese universities[15] and also hires from outside traditional computer science
            fields to broaden its models' knowledge and capabilities.[12]

            DeepSeek significantly reduced training expenses for their R1 model by incorporating techniques such as
            mixture of experts (MoE) layers.[19] The company also trained its models during ongoing trade restrictions
            on AI chip exports to China, using weaker AI chips intended for export and employing fewer units
            overall.[13][20] Observers say this breakthrough sent "shock waves" through the industry, threatening
            established AI hardware leaders such as Nvidia; Nvidia's share price dropped sharply, losing US$600 billion
            in market value, the largest single-company decline in U.S. stock market history.[21][22]</p>
